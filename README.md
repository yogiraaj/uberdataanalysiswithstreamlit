# Uber Data Analysis With Streamlit

This project involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber datasets to analyze rider and driver behavior, demand trends, and route efficiency. The second version of the project is built using **Python**, **PyCharm**, **Jupyter**, **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis of Uber datasets to uncover patterns in rider and driver behaviors.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilization of **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for creating impactful visualizations that reveal trends and insights.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Created with **Streamlit**, providing an easy-to-use interface for users to explore data insights in real-time.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language used for data analysis.
- **PyCharm**: IDE for Python development.
- **Jupyter**: For interactive data exploration and visualization.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application interface.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yogiraaj/uberdataanalysiswithstreamlit.git
   cd uberdataanalysiswithstreamlit

2. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Download the dataset:**

- You can download the Uber ride dataset from Kaggle. Save the dataset in the data/ folder.

4. **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

## Data Analysis
The analysis covers:

- Rider Behavior: Identifying peak times and locations for Uber rides.
- Driver Behavior: Understanding the efficiency of different routes.
- Demand Trends: Analyzing fluctuations in ride requests over time.
- Route Efficiency: Insights on optimizing routes for minimal travel time and costs.

 ## Data Visualizations
Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various visualizations that include:

- Ride demand heatmaps
- Fare pricing trends
- Trip distance distributions
- Analysis of ride frequency across different times and locations

## Future Enhancements
- Advanced Machine Learning Models: Predictive analytics for fare pricing and demand forecasting.
- Enhanced Visualizations: Incorporating more interactive visualizations using Plotly or Bokeh.
- Broader Data Sources: Analyzing external factors such as weather or events impacting Uber demand.
